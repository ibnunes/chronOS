1-  Input the processes along with their burst time (bt).

2-  Find waiting time (wt) for all processes.

3-  As first process that comes need not to wait so
    waiting time for process 1 will be 0 i.e. wt[0] = 0.

4-  Find waiting time for all other processes i.e. for
                    process i -> wt[i] = bt[i-1] + wt[i-1] .

5-  Find turnaround time = waiting_time + burst_time for all processes.

6-  Find average waiting time = total_waiting_time / no_of_processes.

7-  Similarly, find average turnaround time = total_turn_around_time / no_of_processes.
