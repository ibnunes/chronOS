## What is _chronOS_?

**chronOS** is an operating system scheduling simulator. It is built around two main components:

* A process simulator;
* A memory manager.

It is able to use different algorithms, like ***FCFS***, to schedule processes which are as well simulated. The processes consist of changing an unique integer variable.

The **memory manager** uses a ***first-fit* algorithm** to accommodate new instructions of programs.


## How to compile

There are two modes to build:

* **debug** &mdash; outputs very extensive debugging information about the execution of chronOS:
  ```
  make debug
  ```

* **release** &mdash; produces a final version of chronOS with only the absolute essential output:
  ```
  make release
  ```

It is possible to clean the current directories using `make clean`.


## Usage

A file `plan.txt` with the list of programs and times to execute is expected. Without it the program will not execute.
